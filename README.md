This app was designed to provide a great and beautiful experience for the Hacker News reader that uses an iOS device. With a clean and simple interface you can browse HN home page, new and ask sections very easily.

## Technologies used

 * HTML5 & CSS3
 * Javascript with jQuery
 * Phonegap
 * Phonegap Plugins (ChildBrowser, NativeControls)

I want to thanks the Phonegap team for making a awesome work to make it possible for us, developers, to use web technologies to build awesome applications. Also want to thanks the people that develop plugins for Phonegap, which makes our apps feel more native. Special thanks to [Ronnie Roller][1] for making the [iHackerNews API][2]. Thanks for everyone that worked on any of those technologies.

## TODO List

There are some little things that I'm still working on...

 * iPad version
 * A way to up vote and comment (since there is no API this is difficult)
 * Profile view

## Changelog

**v1.0:** First release *(Still not at the App Store)*
